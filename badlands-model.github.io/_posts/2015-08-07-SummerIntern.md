## Post-tectonic landscape recovery

During orogenic periods, the fragmentation of landscapes into myriad of small drainage basins favours the multiplication of ecological niches, driving species differentiation and favouring biodiversity.

In contrast, following a period of orogenesis landscapes return to steady-state equilibrium through erosion and sediment accumulation. During these periods of tectonic quiescence, drainage basins growth larger and the connectivity of ecosystems increases favouring the competition of species. This project examines, through numerical modelling, the recovery of landscape following orogenesis.
