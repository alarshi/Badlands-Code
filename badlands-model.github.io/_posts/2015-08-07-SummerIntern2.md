## Mantle convection and Australian landscape evolution

It has long been identified that continents tilt as they drift over the convecting mantle. Australia is an ideal continent to study this process because it has undergone little tectonic deformation since the Jurassic.

The aim of this project is to model the evolution of the Australian landscape over the last 150 Myr from a history of varying climate, sea level and mantle-driven dynamic topography.

The project will involve analysing the time-dependence of erosion and drainage patterns, and to compare them with denudation rates and paleo-drainage from paleogeography and the sedimentary record in key basins. This will require the use of analytical skills, basic scripting (in shell, python or other) and the use of the surface-process code Badlands.

This project will prepare students both for working in the exploration industry as well as for a research-oriented career in government agencies or universities.
