In this numerical model of landscape evolution we impose over 2 millions of years deformation produced with the Underworld software over an
initial flat surface, ie a 256 km square box at a resolution of 1 km.

On top of the deformed surface, a landscape evolution model, Badlands, is used to simulate both hillslope and overland flow processes induced
by an uniform precipitation rate of 1 m/yr. The Badlands resolution is less than 250 m. The continuous 3D deformation field from Underworld is
imported every 5,000 years into Badlands as an average horizontal and vertical displacement rate.

The geodynamic model boundary conditions forces the formation of pull-apart basins. The internal structure of these basins is highly variable both in
space and time owing to complex stress fields and heterogeneous crustal rheology. This complexity has led to several unresolved problems
regarding the kinematics and dynamics of pull-apart basins.

> Using the coupling between Badlands and Underworld it is now possible to test the time-dependent deformation patterns within pull-apart basins, and the relation of these basins with the adjacent deformed structural domains.
