![Example of Landscape evolution with Badlands](/images/riseofthephoenix.png)

<p class="message">
  This page is just a quick overview of what this code is about.
</p>

The Basin and Landscape Dynamics model (Badlands) is a parallel numerical framework which aims to conduct coupled thermal-mechanical / stratigraphic-oceanic modelling of continental margins, sedimentary basins and associated landscape dynamics.

The project is part of the ARC Basin Genesis Hub initiative aka [BGH](http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=13626).

In August 2016, the first version of the code has been released under a Lesser Gnu Public License.
The current version deals with landscape dynamic under imposed climatic and tectonic conditions and simulates surface evolution as well as sediment erosion, transport and deposition.
